# Git Training using Githup Essentials

Working along with WebStorm to learn how to use Github.  Training so far:

1.  Created node project __File__, __New__, __Project..__, giving it the name __github-essentials__..Web Storm will prompt you to create a README.md and .gitignore files.  Go on and do it as they should be done as good practice.  I didn't do anything to the README.md file so an emptyone was created.  I later used the Multimarkdown plugin to maintain the READE.md file.  Web Storm will genet a .gitignore file appropriate for node.
2.  In __Pereferences__, __Version Control__, - __Github__
3.  Set username and password to github account at www.github.com; all other parameters took default.
4.  Tested it to make sure the login  works by pressing the __Test__ button.
5.  Under __VCS__, __Import Into Version Control__, __Create Git Repository__, give it the name __git_essentials__
6.  Under __VCS__, Selected __Commit Changes__, committed to local git repository
7.  Under __VCS__, __Git__, __Push__, pushed changes to cloud repository
8.
